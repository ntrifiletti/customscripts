## Barracuda CloudGen Firewall (CGF) Custom Scripts for Migration
## Introduction
The Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates in this repo will deploy single instance or HA clusters of Barracuda CloudGen Firewall F Series virtual machines in an existing VNET. The templates are barebone configurations and exclude Azure Load Balancers (ELB/ILB), route tables and the applicable variables.

These templates are useful when migrating to existing resource groups, vnets and where you intend to reuse existing Azure infrastructure like Load Balancers and Public IP's.

Additional Azure Templates can be found on the [Barracuda Networks CGF Azure Repo](https://github.com/barracudanetworks/ngf-azure-templates)

## Prerequisites
`Important - The templates are designed to be deployed into Resource Groups and VNET's that already exist!`

The solution does a check of the template when you use the provide scripts. It does require that [Programmatic Deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/working-with-marketplace-images-on-azure-resource-manager/) is enabled for the Barracuda CloudGen Firewall F BYOL or PAYG images. Barracuda recommends use of **DS2_v2**, **Dv3_v3**, or newer series. 

You can enable programmatic deployment via Powershell using the Cloud Shell feature in the portal. Below are two powershell examples for byol and hourly, please adapt as required to your version of powershell and byol or hourly license requirement.

#BYOL Licenses

`Get-AzMarketplaceTerms -Publisher "barracudanetworks" -Product "barracuda-ng-firewall" -Name "byol" | Set-AzMarketplaceTerms -Accept`

#PAYG/Hourly Licenses (license included)

`Get-AzureRmMarketplaceTerms -Publisher "barracudanetworks" -Product "barracuda-ng-firewall" -Name "hourly" | Set-AzureRmMarketplaceTerms -Accept`

Following resources will be created by these templates:

- One virtual machine with network interface, NSG, public IP
- Public IP's SKU's are set to basic and should dissociated and deleted during the appropriate migration steps.
- Deploys into existing resource group and VNET
- Template has parameter to set static IP address during preconfiguration
